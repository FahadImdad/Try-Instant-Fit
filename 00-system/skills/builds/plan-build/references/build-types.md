# Build Types & Adaptive Planning Guide

**Purpose**: Guide AI in offering appropriate build types and adapting planning templates based on user needs.

**Router Pattern**: plan-build semantically matches user input against _type.yaml descriptions.

|------|-------------|------------------|
| **build** | Creating software, features, tools, systems | Inline |
| **integration** | Connecting APIs, external services, webhooks | Skill: add-integration |
| **research** | Academic papers, systematic analysis | Skill: create-research-build |
| **strategy** | Business decisions, planning, analysis | Inline |
| **content** | Marketing, documentation, creative work | Inline |
| **process** | Workflow optimization, automation | Inline |
| **skill** | Creating Nexus skills and capabilities | Skill: create-skill |

### 8. Generic Builds

**Description**: Doesn't fit other categories or user prefers minimal structure

**Examples**:
- "Misc tasks for Q1"
- "Personal learning goals"
- Custom work

**Discovery Method**: Inline (minimal questions)

**Adaptive Sections for plan.md**:
- Keep minimal base template
- User defines structure as needed

---

## Type Detection (Semantic Matching)

The router does NOT use keyword triggers. Instead:

1. **Read all _type.yaml descriptions**
2. **Compare user input semantically** against descriptions
3. **Select best match** OR ask user if ambiguous

**Example**:
```
User: "plan build for slack notifications"

AI reads _type.yaml descriptions:
- integration: "Connect external APIs and services" ← best match
- build: "Create software, features, tools"
- skill: "Create Nexus skills"

AI: "This looks like an Integration build. I'll use add-integration
     to discover Slack's API. Sound right?"
```

### If Ambiguous

```markdown
I detected this could be a few different build types:

1. **Integration** - Connecting Slack API
2. **Build** - Building notification system
3. **Skill** - Creating reusable notification skill

Which type best matches what you're building?
```

## EARS Requirements (Build/Skill Types)

For **build** and **skill** builds, discovery includes EARS-formatted requirements:

| Pattern | Template | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Ubiquitous | THE `<system>` SHALL `<response>` | THE API SHALL validate inputs |
| Event-driven | WHEN `<trigger>`, THE `<system>` SHALL `<response>` | WHEN user clicks, THE form SHALL submit |
| State-driven | WHILE `<condition>`, THE `<system>` SHALL `<response>` | WHILE loading, THE UI SHALL show spinner |
| Unwanted | IF `<condition>`, THEN THE `<system>` SHALL `<response>` | IF error, THEN THE system SHALL log |
| Optional | WHERE `<option>`, THE `<system>` SHALL `<response>` | WHERE debug mode, THE logger SHALL verbose |
| Complex | Combined patterns | WHERE admin, WHEN delete, THE system SHALL confirm |

**See**: [ears-patterns.md](ears-patterns.md) for full guide.

## Correctness Properties (Build/Skill Types)

For **build** and **skill** builds, plan.md includes Correctness Properties:

```markdown
## Correctness Properties

**Property 1: Input Validation**
For all user inputs, the system either accepts valid input OR returns descriptive error.
**Validates**: REQ-2, REQ-3

**Property 2: State Consistency**
For any operation sequence, resume-context.md reflects actual state.
**Validates**: REQ-4
```

---

## Dependencies & Links Section (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Every plan.md MUST include this section, populated by AI through research.

### AI's Research Checklist (MANDATORY)

**This checklist is NOT optional.** AI MUST complete all 3 phases before proceeding to mental models.

Before completing plan.md, AI must:

1. **Phase 2a: Discovery Questions** - Understand what user wants to build
   - [ ] What are you building? (1-2 sentence description)
   - [ ] What problem does this solve?
   - [ ] Who/what will use this?
   - [ ] Any constraints or requirements?
   - [ ] What does success look like?

2. **Phase 2b: Active Research** - AI explores based on answers
   - [ ] Search targets extracted from user's answers
   - [ ] Complexity assessed (Simple/Medium/Complex)
   - [ ] Subagents spawned (0-5 based on complexity)
   - [ ] Codebase searched for related files
   - [ ] Related builds checked in 02-builds/
   - [ ] Related skills checked in 03-skills/ and 00-system/skills/
   - [ ] Integration configs checked in 01-memory/integrations/
   - [ ] Web search performed (if relevant)
   - [ ] Findings consolidated and presented to user

3. **Phase 2c: Informed Follow-ups** - Questions + optional follow-up research
   - [ ] Follow-up questions reference research findings
   - [ ] New areas discovered? → Loop back to 2b (max 2 loops)
   - [ ] All gaps addressed before proceeding

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] All findings written to 02-discovery.md (not just chat)
   - [ ] Dependencies & Links section populated in plan.md

**See**: [active-discovery-guide.md](active-discovery-guide.md) for detailed patterns and examples.

---

## Mental Models (After Discovery)

Mental models are applied AFTER discovery, not before:

1. **First Principles** - Strip assumptions, find fundamental truths
2. **Pre-Mortem** - Imagine failure before implementation
3. **Devil's Advocate** - Identify risks and blind spots
4. **Stakeholder Mapping** - Identify affected parties

**Key Insight**: Questions are INFORMED by discovery:
- "Given your requirement REQ-1, what assumptions are embedded?"
- "Given these API constraints, what could break?"

---

## Quality Checklist for AI

Before completing build creation, verify:

- [ ] Build type correctly detected (semantic matching)
- [ ] Phase 2a Discovery Questions completed (understand what user wants)
- [ ] Phase 2b Active Research completed (AI explores based on answers)
- [ ] Phase 2c Informed Follow-ups completed (questions + optional follow-up research)
- [ ] Follow-up research loops completed if needed (max 2 loops)
- [ ] All discovery findings written to 02-discovery.md
- [ ] Mental models applied to discovery findings
- [ ] Dependencies & Links section researched and populated
- [ ] Resume-context.md updated with phase transitions
- [ ] User confirmed understanding at each pause

---

**Remember**: The router ensures every build gets proper discovery and mental model application. Discovery BEFORE mental models ensures informed questioning.
